    description: `Developed an AI-powered mock interview platform enabling candidates to prepare for technical and behavioral interviews using role-specific question sets.
- Implemented audio-recording and pronunciation-analysis functionalities to give users feedback both on content and speech delivery.
- Built the frontend using Next.js (15.3.3) with React (18.3.1), TypeScript (5.9.2), Tailwind CSS (3.4.1), and Radix UI through shadcn/ui components for a clean, scalable design system.
- Integrated AI workflows using Google Genkit (1.14.1) and the @genkit-ai/googleai provider to dynamically generate interview questions and assess responses.`,

    description: `Built a conditional GAN pipeline that generates images from text embeddings by training paired generator–discriminator models on captioned datasets.
- Engineered preprocessing modules to convert textual descriptions into vector embeddings and aligned them with image samples for supervised adversarial training.
- Improved model stability and output quality using techniques such as label smoothing, conditional batch normalization, and performance evaluation with FID/Inception Score.`,

    description: `Engineered a fully on-device assistive technology platform supporting real-time OCR, speech-to-text captioning, scene recognition, and gesture-based control using only mobile phone hardware.
- Implemented native Android modules (CameraX, AudioRecord, TFLite) integrated with a Flutter UI via Platform Channels to deliver low-latency accessibility functions for visually, hearing, and motor-impaired users.
- Designed adaptive accessibility interfaces with high-contrast themes, large-target layouts, and hands-free interaction powered by head-pose estimation and voice commands.`,
